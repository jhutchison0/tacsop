description: Multi-tier testing strategy with vertical-slicing (tracer-bullet) TDD, mocks, fixtures, simulation, CI integration, and explicit anti-patterns. Use when setting up test infrastructure, designing test strategy, implementing mocks, or driving feature work via test-first one-cycle-at-a-time TDD.

# Shift-Left Testing

Move testing earlier in the development cycle — test components before integration, test with mocks before hardware, test logic before dependencies exist. This SKILL.md is the entry point; deep procedural content lives in sidecar files loaded on demand.

**Philosophy**: *"Never skip tests because dependencies aren't ready. Mock what you don't have, test what you build, validate continuously."*

## When to Use

- Setting up test infrastructure for a new project or component
- Designing the test strategy for a feature before writing code
- Implementing mocks for external dependencies
- Driving feature work via test-first TDD (the vertical-slicing rhythm)
- Reviewing test coverage, quality, or detecting anti-patterns

## Core Principles

Four rules that govern everything else in this skill:

1. **Test independence.** Every test runs in isolation. No shared mutable state between tests, no execution-order dependencies.
2. **Mock external dependencies.** Never let tests depend on APIs, databases, hardware, or other services you don't fully control.
3. **Test early, test often.** Write tests before or alongside code, never after. Vertical slicing (one test → one implementation → repeat) is the rhythm; see `VERTICAL-SLICING.md`.
4. **Fail fast, fail clear.** Tests should fail quickly with messages that name what's wrong, not just that something is wrong.

## Quick Reference

### Test Pyramid

```
         /\
        /  \   E2E / External (few, slow, complete system)
       /____\
      /      \
     / System  \  (few, slow, end-to-end)
    /__________\
   /            \
  /  Integration  \  (medium quantity, medium speed)
 /__________________\
/                    \
/    Unit Tests        \  (many, fast, isolated)
/______________________\
```

### Test Tiers

| Tier | Speed | Scope | Dependencies | Share of total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | <1s | Single component | Mocked | 60–70% |
| Integration | 1–10s | Component interaction | Some real, some mocked | 20–30% |
| System | 10–60s | End-to-end | Real or simulated | 5–10% |
| External | >60s | With real external systems | Real APIs/hardware | Optional |

### Test Directory Layout

```
tests/
├── fixtures/           # Shared test data, mock objects
├── unit/               # Fast, isolated component tests
├── integration/        # Multi-component interaction tests
├── simulation/         # Digital twin / simulated environment tests
└── external/           # Real external system tests (optional)
```

### Naming Conventions

- Test files: `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- Test functions: `test_*`
- Test classes: `Test*`

Anything else won't be auto-discovered by pytest.
