# Claude Skills Framework

**Created**: 2025-11-13
**Last Updated**: 2026-05-19
**Status**: Active per Anthropic Skills open standard (December 18, 2025)

## Overview

A **skill** is a self-loading capability with a name and a description, aligned with the Anthropic Skills open standard. At session start, only the YAML frontmatter (`name` + `description`) is loaded into Claude's context; Anthropic measures this at roughly 30–80 tokens per skill in practice. The body of `SKILL.md` loads only when Claude judges the skill relevant; supporting files in the skill directory load only when the body references them.

This is **progressive disclosure**; see [Anthropic's skills documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) for the canonical reference.

Skills are organized hierarchically to maximize reuse across projects and downstream consumers.

---

## Skill Hierarchy

```
Level 0: Universal Foundation
├── Applicable to ANY software project
├── No project names, no domain-specific content
├── Pure software engineering best practices
└── Portable across all repositories

Level 1: Project-Specific Skills
├── Tailored to this project's domain
├── References specific APIs, tools, patterns
└── Built on top of Level 0 foundation
```

---

## Skill File Forms

The Anthropic open standard supports two valid forms. Both work; we use both.

### Directory form (preferred for new skills)

```
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md          # Required. Frontmatter + body. Under 500 lines.
├── REFERENCE.md      # Optional. Loaded only when SKILL.md cites it.
├── EXAMPLES.md       # Optional. Loaded only when SKILL.md cites it.
└── scripts/          # Optional. Helper scripts the skill can invoke.
```

Use directory form when the skill carries reference content, examples, or scripts that should not load by default. This is the standard form for progressive disclosure.

### Single-file form (legacy)

```
.claude/skills/<skill-name>.md
```

Use single-file form for short, self-contained skills that don't need sidecar files. As of 2026-05-19 all Level 0 skills in this template have migrated to directory form; the legacy single-file form is documented for reference and remains valid for any future skill small enough not to need sidecars.

---

## Frontmatter Specification

Every skill (in either form) starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-in-gerund-form
description: One sentence that includes BOTH what the skill does AND when to invoke it. The description is the only discovery signal Claude uses — it must read naturally.
version: "1.0.0"
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit"]   # optional; restricts what the skill may invoke
---
```

**Naming rules** (from Anthropic's skill-authoring guidance):
- Names are **gerund form**: `maintaining-ubiquitous-language`, not `ubiquitous-language-manager`.
- Names are **kebab-case**: lowercase with hyphens.
- Names are **action-oriented**: they describe what the skill does, not what it is.

**Description rules**:
- One to three sentences; the first states what the skill does, the last states when to use it. (Was "one sentence" until 2026-08-27; the writing and figure skills carry three, and a downstream gate flagged the mismatch.)
- Must include **what** the skill does.
- Must include **when** to invoke it (the trigger conditions Claude uses to decide auto-activation).
- Third-person, present tense.
- Concrete enough to disambiguate from neighboring skills.

**Good description**: "Maintain a project-specific glossary of domain terms in LANGUAGE.md at the repo root. Use when a new domain term emerges in conversation, when reviewing code with inconsistent terminology, or when onboarding a new contributor or agent."

**Bad description**: "Manages vocabulary." (No when, no what, no specificity.)

---

## Progressive Disclosure

**Rule**: SKILL.md body stays under 500 lines.

Detailed reference content lives in sidecar files (`REFERENCE.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, `<topic>.md`) inside the skill directory. SKILL.md cites them by relative path when needed. Sidecar files are loaded into Claude's context **only when SKILL.md body references them**; this keeps the per-skill token cost bounded.

If a skill's SKILL.md is creeping past 400 lines, the right move is usually to extract reference material into a sidecar.

---

## Level 0: Universal Foundation Skills

These skills are portable to any software project. They contain no project names, no domain-specific content. All current Level 0 skills use directory form with sidecars for progressive disclosure.

### configuration-management (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/configuration-management/SKILL.md` + 5 sidecars (`STRUCTURE-AND-FILES.md`, `LOADER.md`, `SECRETS.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, `TESTING-AND-PATTERNS.md`).

**Focus**: Hierarchical YAML configuration systems with profiles, secrets, and environment management.

**Use when**: Setting up config systems, managing secrets, switching environments, refactoring hardcoded values, auditing config architecture.

### shift-left-testing (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/shift-left-testing/SKILL.md` + 7 sidecars (`TIERS.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `MOCKS.md`, `FIXTURES.md`, `VERTICAL-SLICING.md`, `CI.md`, `ANTIPATTERNS.md`).

**Focus**: Multi-tier testing strategy with vertical-slicing (tracer-bullet) TDD, mocks, fixtures, simulation, CI integration, and explicit anti-patterns.

**Use when**: Setting up test infrastructure, designing test strategy, implementing mocks, driving feature work via test-first TDD.

### python-venv-management (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/python-venv-management/SKILL.md` + 2 sidecars (`SETUP.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).

**Focus**: Python virtual environment creation, management, and troubleshooting.

**Use when**: Setting up Python environments, resolving dependency conflicts, automating setup, migrating off system Python.

### maintaining-ubiquitous-language (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/maintaining-ubiquitous-language/SKILL.md`

**Focus**: Maintain LANGUAGE.md at the repo root as the project's living glossary of domain terms.

**Key concepts**: one-sentence definitions, define-what-it-IS-not-what-it-does, `_Avoid:_` synonyms, glossary-not-spec discipline.

**Use when**: A new domain term emerges; terminology is inconsistent in code review; a new contributor or agent onboards; an existing definition becomes stale.

### maintaining-project-context (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/maintaining-project-context/SKILL.md`

**Focus**: Maintain CONTEXT.md at the repo root capturing project identity, mission, current state, and constraints.

**Key concepts**: project identity vs config state, narrative-not-machine-readable, distinguishes from LANGUAGE.md (terms) and project.yaml (machine-readable state).

**Use when**: Significant new work starts; mission or scope changes; an agent needs project context quickly; downstream relationships change.

### recording-architecture-decisions (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/recording-architecture-decisions/SKILL.md`

**Focus**: Record architectural decisions in `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md` only when the triple filter passes.

**Key concepts**: triple filter (hard-to-reverse AND surprising-without-context AND result-of-real-trade-off), sequential numbering, never-ADR-routine-choices.

**Use when**: A decision is made that satisfies all three filter conditions. Do not write an ADR otherwise.

### using-topic-branches (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/using-topic-branches/SKILL.md`

**Focus**: Branch by work shape, not by domain: lead-only doc, ADR, and small-refactor work lands on `main`; team-deployed or multi-agent code work with an audit gate uses a short-lived `topic/<scope>-<slug>` branch, merged at the gate and deleted (local and origin) at once.

**Key concepts**: work shape over permanent partition, merge-commit at the gate, delete-after-merge, standing-branch audit.

**Use when**: Starting a unit of work, deciding whether to branch, merging at a gate, or auditing standing branches across a repo.

### writing-simple-and-direct (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/writing-simple-and-direct/SKILL.md` + 4 sidecars (`RULES.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, `REVIEWING.md`, `ADOPTION.md`).

**Focus**: House prose style distilled from Barzun's *Simple and Direct*: eight kernel rules with expansions, before/after patterns, and a review protocol for every prose artifact. The figure skill's twin: this one governs the words, that one governs the ink.

**Key concepts**: have a point and state it first, the concrete word, one idea per sentence, active voice, cruft words (the banned list in LANGUAGE.md), hedge with numbers, no em dashes in running prose; schemas define what, this defines how.

**Use when**: Writing or reviewing any prose artifact (status reports, reviews, proposals, ADRs, session docs, backbriefs, commit messages).

### traversing-the-knowledge-base (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/traversing-the-knowledge-base/SKILL.md`

**Focus**: Walk the repo's existing link graph (typed session-doc headers, markdown links, bare path mentions) instead of keyword search: lineage, blast radius, neighbors in both directions, why-does-this-exist, reference integrity.

**Key concepts**: the corpus is already a graph, match paths not just links, inbound plus outbound, the `KB-graph:` evidence line, the five-session falsifiable criterion (M1 uptake, M2 integrity, M3 routing value).

**Use when**: Tracing why an artifact exists, assessing blast radius before editing a living doc, orienting on session lineage, or checking reference integrity.

### designing-clear-data-displays (directory form)

**Path**: `.claude/skills/designing-clear-data-displays/SKILL.md` + 4 sidecars (`RULES.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, `REVIEWING.md`, `ADOPTION.md`).

**Focus**: House figure style distilled from Edward Tufte's books and course: eight kernel rules with sources and tests, generic before/after pairs, and a review protocol for charts, figures, maps, tables, and data-bearing layouts. The prose skill's twin: that one governs the words, this one governs the ink.

**Key concepts**: data-ink within reason, label where the data lives, smallest effective difference, 1 + 1 = 3 placement faults, lie factor 0.95 to 1.05, small multiples, documentation on the figure, content counts most. A repo's UX rules outrank the style; state the override.

**Use when**: Drawing or reviewing any data display; writing code that places marks and labels; adopting the skill in a downstream repo.

### task management (command: `/task`)

**Focus**: Military-inspired work tracking with structured escalation from tasks to operations orders.

**Key concepts**: Task list management, escalation ladder (Task → TCS → CONOP → OPORD), decision-point guidance for promotion, backbrief generation, team composition recommendations.

**Use when**: Tracking work items, deciding how to scope work, promoting simple tasks to structured plans, generating progress reports.

## Level 1: Project-Specific Skills

This template has no Level 1 skills yet. Project-specific skills would be added by downstream consumers based on their domain.

Examples from downstream repos:
- A data pipeline project might add `validating-input-schemas` or `generating-pipeline-reports`.
- A decision-support tool might add `eliciting-criterion-weights` or `comparing-scenarios`.

---

## Skill Structure Template

For directory-form skills:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name-in-gerund-form
description: One sentence with both what and when.
version: "1.0.0"
---

# Skill Title

## When to Use

Specific trigger conditions. Match the description, expanded.

## Procedure

Step-by-step guidance. Code blocks for commands. Tables for quick reference.

## Examples

Real-world usage examples.

## Sidecar Files

- `REFERENCE.md` — detailed reference (loaded only on demand)
- `EXAMPLES.md` — extended examples (loaded only on demand)

## References

External sources, prior art, related skills.
```

For single-file skills, use the same structure without a directory wrapper.

---

## Content Guidelines

### Do
- Include exact commands that can be copy-pasted.
- Provide expected output examples.
- Add safety warnings where relevant.
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting.
- Add tables for quick reference.
- Keep descriptions concise and actionable.
- Cite external sources when adopting patterns.

### Don't
- Write verbose prose without action.
- Include project-specific references in Level 0 skills.
- Use vague descriptions ("might work", "usually").
- Duplicate information across skills.
- Assume user knowledge; say what to check.

---

## Civilian / Military Vocabulary Crosswalk

This template's internal docs use military-derived vocabulary (PCC, PCI, SITREP, OPORD, CONOP, TCS, wave). Externally-shared content (anything that propagates downstream or appears in skill descriptions visible to downstream maintainers) uses the civilian equivalent.

| Internal (military) | External (civilian) |
|---|---|
| PCC | pre-commit-check |
| PCI | pre-merge-inspection |
| SITREP | status-report |
| OPORD | operations-order |
| CONOP | concept-of-operations |
| TCS | task-condition-standard |
| wave | execution-phase |
| backbrief | progress-summary |
| METL | mission-essential-task-list |

**Rule**: Skill descriptions and any sidecar files that travel downstream substitute civilian terms. Internal commentary, session docs, and `docs/plans/` content stay in military vocabulary.

The full crosswalk lives in [`LANGUAGE.md`](../../LANGUAGE.md).

---

## Skill Maintenance

### When to update skills
- After discovering better procedures.
- When finding new troubleshooting solutions.
- After dependency or platform version changes.
- When project structure changes (Level 1 only).
- When the Anthropic open standard evolves (re-check December 18, 2025 spec annually).

### Version numbering (semver-style)
- **Patch** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): minor fixes, typos.
- **Minor** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): new sections, procedures added.
- **Major** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): breaking changes, complete rewrites.

---

## Skills vs Commands vs Documentation

| Skills (`.claude/skills/`) | Commands (`.claude/commands/`) | Docs (`docs/`) |
|---|---|---|
| Self-loading capability | User-invoked workflow | Reference content |
| Claude decides when to use | User decides when to use | Read on demand |
| Auto-trigger or explicit `/name` | Always explicit `/name` | Linked from skills/commands |
| Best for: reusable expertise | Best for: deterministic workflows with side effects | Best for: stable reference |

**Rule of thumb**: if it has side effects (commits, file writes, destructive operations), it should be a **command**, not a skill, because explicit user invocation is required. Skills are for capability that Claude can self-trigger safely.

This is why `session-end`, `pcc`, `pci`, `sitrep`, `session-start`, and `task` remain commands and **are not** migrated to skills.

## Porting Skills to New Projects

When starting a new project from this template:

1. **Copy Level 0 skills** directly (they're universal). All current Level 0 skills are portable.
2. **Create project-specific Level 1 skills** as needed.
3. **Update this file** to list the project's Level 1 skills.
4. **Never modify Level 0 content** for project-specific needs; create a Level 1 skill instead, or propose a doctrine update so all consumers benefit.
5. **For LANGUAGE.md and CONTEXT.md**, start with the template files at the repo root and customize. These are project-specific by nature; the skills that maintain them are Level 0 (universal pattern, project-specific content).
