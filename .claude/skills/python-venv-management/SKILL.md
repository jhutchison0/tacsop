# Python Virtual Environment Management

Isolate Python dependencies per project, prevent conflicts between projects requiring different package versions. This SKILL.md is the entry point; deep procedural content lives in two sidecar files loaded on demand.

**Philosophy**: *"One project, one environment. Isolate dependencies, document requirements, automate setup."*

## When to Use

- Setting up a new Python project (always)
- Resolving a `pip install` conflict between two packages
- Managing multiple environments for the same project (Python version matrix, optional heavy deps)
- Writing or auditing a project's setup script / Makefile
- Migrating an existing codebase off system Python
- Diagnosing "module not found" or "wrong Python version" errors

## Core Principles

1. **One venv per project.** Default; deviate only with a documented reason.
2. **Activate inside the venv.** All `pip` and `python` commands run inside the activated venv. Never use `sudo pip`.
3. **Pin production dependencies.** Reproducible builds beat flexibility-at-deploy-time.
4. **Never commit secrets or the venv directory.** `.venv/` and `.env` both belong in `.gitignore`.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Create venv | `python -m venv .venv` |
| Activate (Linux/Mac) | `source .venv/bin/activate` |
| Activate (Windows) | `.venv\Scripts\activate` |
| Deactivate | `deactivate` |
| Install deps | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Install project (editable) | `pip install -e .` |
| Install with dev deps | `pip install -e ".[dev]"` |
| Freeze deps to file | `pip freeze > requirements.txt` |
| Upgrade pip | `pip install --upgrade pip` |
| List packages | `pip list` |
| Show package info | `pip show <package>` |
| Check what's installed | `which python` (should show `.venv/bin/python`) |

### Directory Conventions

```
project/
├── .venv/                  # Virtual environment (gitignored)
├── requirements.txt        # Production dependencies
├── requirements-dev.txt    # Development dependencies
├── requirements-test.txt   # Test dependencies (optional)
└── pyproject.toml          # Modern Python project config (preferred)
```

### `.gitignore` Essentials

```gitignore
# Virtual environments
.venv/
venv/
ENV/
.venv-*/

# Environment files (secrets)
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Keep templates
!.env.example
```

## Sidecar Files

Loaded on demand when this SKILL.md cites them.

- [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) — single-vs-multiple environments, setup patterns (bash script, Makefile, pyproject.toml), requirements file organization, pinning strategy, Python version management (pyenv).
- [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) — dependency conflict resolution, environment variables and secrets, the seven most common venv failure modes with diagnoses and fixes, do/don't checklist.

## Quick Anti-Pattern Reference

- **`sudo pip install`** — never. Indicates you're installing to system Python, not your venv.
- **Committing `.venv/`** — adds gigabytes of OS-specific binaries to git.
- **`pip freeze > requirements.txt` as your only spec** — captures transitive deps and platform quirks; combine with hand-curated direct deps in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Sharing a venv across projects** — defeats the isolation that's the entire point.
- **Mixing system Python and venv** — `which python` should always point at your `.venv/bin/python` when activated.
