# ENFORCEMENT — How Shift-Left-Testing Is Made to Stick

Sidecar to `SKILL.md`. Documents the deterministic mechanisms layered on top of the (probabilistic) skill itself, so the discipline survives contact with agents that may not read it.

## The Problem This Sidecar Solves

`VERTICAL-SLICING.md` states the discipline: write a failing test, then the minimum implementation that passes it, then move to the next slice. A skill describes; it does not enforce. Whether any agent invokes the skill on any given turn is decided by the model — probabilistic, not deterministic. The user framing: *"claude dice."* The dice often come up favorable. Not always. We layer mechanisms that fire on every relevant action so the discipline does not depend on a single roll.

## Enforcement Gradient

Doctrine is enforced at multiple layers. Each is either probabilistic or deterministic, and either blocking or non-blocking.

| # | Layer | Determinism | Blocking? | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The skill itself (`VERTICAL-SLICING.md`) | Probabilistic | No | Agent reads when relevant |
| 2 | `CLAUDE.md` Development Principle | Probabilistic | No | Agent reads at session start |
| 3 | `python-prototyper.md` workflow | Probabilistic | No | Agent definition prescribes order |
| 4 | **PostToolUse audit hook** | **Deterministic** | **No (logs + warns)** | Harness runs after every Write/Edit |
| 5 | Stop hook diff audit | Deterministic | No (logs + warns) | Harness runs at end of every turn |
| 6 | PreToolUse block hook | Deterministic | Yes (blocks) | Harness refuses Write/Edit before condition met |

Layers 1–4 are currently active in this repo. Layer 5 is a candidate for the next iteration. **Layer 6 is intentionally not configured** — see "Why not hard blocks" below.

## What the Audit Hook Does (Layer 4)

The PostToolUse hook at `.claude/hooks/post-tool-shift-left-audit.sh` fires after every `Write` or `Edit` tool call. It:

1. Exits silently for tools other than `Write` / `Edit`.
2. Exits silently for paths outside `src/myproject/**/*.py`.
3. Exits silently for `__init__.py`, `conftest.py`, and any file already matching `test_*.py` / `*_test.py`.
4. Infers the test partner: `tests/**/test_<basename>.py` via `find`.
5. If the test partner does not exist, appends a `MISSING_TEST` line to `.claude/audits/shift-left-violations.log` and writes a one-line warning to stderr (which the harness surfaces back to the agent in the tool result).
6. If the test partner exists, appends an `OK_TEST_EXISTS` line for each match.

The hook never blocks. Output is evidence, not friction. The script `set -uo pipefail` (deliberately not `-e`) and always `exit 0` so a transient failure cannot suppress the tool call.

## Why Not Hard Blocks (Layer 6)

A `PreToolUse` hook on `Write|Edit` to `src/myproject/**/*.py` that refused the tool call when no test partner existed would be the strictest form of enforcement. It was MAUT-evaluated against soft-deterministic alternatives in `docs/reviews/20260519_pass4_enforcement_maut.md` and lost on three counts:

- **False positives**: legitimate refactors, renames, doc-string fixes, and exploratory prototyping have no immediate test-first need. A hard block would punish every one of them.
- **Bypass cost is too low**: an agent that wants to route around the block can write to a different path, then move the file. Or write to a tests file first as a stub. The friction lands on legitimate work; the workaround for bad behavior is trivial.
- **Educational vs punitive**: the goal is to teach the discipline, not to punish violations. Soft-deterministic mechanisms produce evidence (`MISSING_TEST` count over time) that informs a later decision about whether escalation is needed; hard blocks produce only resistance.

If the audit log shows persistent violations after the soft mechanism has been in place long enough to be unambiguous, the answer is to convene a review of the violations and decide whether to escalate or whether the violations are legitimate exceptions. The default direction is **add more evidence collection, not more refusal**.

## What the Hook Catches and What It Misses

**Catches**:
- New production code in `src/myproject/` with no test partner at all.
- Code that has fallen out of sync (test deleted, impl remains).
- Edits to legacy untested code (surfaces the existing gap without requiring a separate audit pass).

**Misses**:
- **Temporal vertical-slicing violations**: writing all tests first, then all impl. Both have test partners; the temporal discipline gap is invisible to a name-existence check.
- Test stubs that exist but contain no assertions.
- Tests in non-standard locations (the inference is strictly `tests/**/test_<basename>.py`).
- Commits made outside Claude Code (CI checks would catch some of these — see `CI.md`).
- Tests that exist but don't actually test the new code (e.g., a stale `test_foo.py` that doesn't cover the new `foo.bar()` function).

The "misses" list is what the (probabilistic) skill is for. Hooks reduce dependence on the dice; they do not eliminate it.

## Reading the Audit Log

```bash
# Count violations by type
grep -c MISSING_TEST .claude/audits/shift-left-violations.log
grep -c OK_TEST_EXISTS .claude/audits/shift-left-violations.log

# Recent violations (last 20)
grep MISSING_TEST .claude/audits/shift-left-violations.log | tail -20

# Per-file violation count
grep MISSING_TEST .claude/audits/shift-left-violations.log \
  | sed 's/.*file=\([^ ]*\).*/\1/' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

The log is append-only. It is not committed (gitignore via `.claude/audits/`). Rotate or truncate manually if it grows unwieldy.

## When to Escalate to Hard Blocks (Layer 6)

Triggers that warrant a re-evaluation:

- More than 20 `MISSING_TEST` events in a single month in a single repo.
- A pattern where the same file appears repeatedly in `MISSING_TEST` over multiple sessions.
- A code-review consensus that the audit log shows discipline drift, not legitimate exceptions.

The re-evaluation should re-run the MAUT in `docs/reviews/20260519_pass4_enforcement_maut.md` with updated weights and write a new ADR if the recommendation flips.

## Propagation

This sidecar propagates downstream as part of the `shift-left-testing` skill bundle. The hook script (`.claude/hooks/post-tool-shift-left-audit.sh`) and the `settings.json` snippet propagate alongside as **template-copy** artifacts. Downstream repos may customize the `src/<project>/` and `tests/` path patterns inside the hook script to match their layout; the audit log path and behavior should remain unchanged.

The propagation entry must call out that adopting this enforcement layer is the consumer repo's choice: a `settings.local.json` override can disable the hook per developer without modifying the propagated `settings.json`.
