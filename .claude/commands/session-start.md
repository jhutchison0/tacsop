# Session Start - Load Context

Load project context and prepare for a new development session.

## Step 1: Read Project Configuration

Read `config/project.yaml` - the central source of truth containing:
- Current phase and version
- Design pillars
- Build phases with status tracking
- Directory structure
- The machine roster (`machines:`), read in Step 1.5

## Step 1.5: Identify the Machine

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m src.myproject.utils.machine
```

Prints one line, for example `titanx (workstation, work+personal)`. Report it.

This runs before Step 4 because Step 4 is the first step whose behavior depends
on where you are: which remotes reach, whether a git identity is set, which
reference repos exist on disk.

If the output says the host is not in the roster, say so and offer to add it to
`config/project.yaml` under `machines:`. Do not add it silently. An unlisted box
still works; it just knows less.

## Step 2: Check Current Phase

Read `config/project.yaml` build_phases section:
- Find the current active phase (status: "in_progress")
- Understand what's being built
- What's the deliverable for this phase?
- What phases are completed vs pending?

## Step 3: Load Recent Session

Find and read the most recently modified file in `docs/sessions/` to understand what was done last session.

## Step 3.5: Check Task List

Read `docs/tasks.md` and report:
- Active tasks (count and list)
- Blocked tasks (count and reasons)
- Any stale tasks (no update in 3+ sessions)
- Suggest which active tasks align with today's work

## Step 3.6: Check Upstream Doctrine Updates

Check if `.claude/upstream-update.md` exists. If it does:
- Read and surface the contents to the user
- Flag it prominently: **"Upstream doctrine update available — review before proceeding"**
- Do NOT delete the file — the user decides when to act on it

## Step 4: Verify Health

Run these commands:
```bash
git fetch && git pull # Sync with remote before anything else
pytest                # Verify all tests pass
git status            # Check for uncommitted changes
git branch -v         # Current branch state
```

## Step 5: Summarize and Ready

Provide a brief summary:

1. **Machine**: Which box this is, from Step 1.5
2. **Version**: Current version from project.yaml
3. **Phase**: Current build phase and its deliverable
4. **Recent Work**: Last session summary
5. **Tasks**: Active count, blocked count, top priority items
6. **Pending**: Key items remaining in current phase
7. **Test Status**: All passing or failures?
8. **Git State**: Branch, uncommitted changes?

Then ask: **"What would you like to work on today?"**
